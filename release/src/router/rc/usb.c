 * There is no reason that we should have to serialize this code, but
 * we have to.  Otherwise we will occasionally lock up when
 * we repeatedly plug and unplug a hub with several USB storage devices
 * connected to it.  This is probably be a bug in the kernel.  Like some
 * critical data structure that isn't protected by a lock.  There's a
 * lot of kernel threads that are doing things to the USB device.
 *
 * Oh well-----serializing this code seems to avoid the problem.
 *
 * Notes on testing the position of the lock.
 * Spawning 5 hotplug threads.  2 for hub, 3 scsi hosts.
 * 6 total partitions on 3 hosts. (1 & 2 & 3)
 * 1st for add, 2nd for remove, loop 20+ times.
 * No /etc/fstab.
 * "fails" = router locks up
 *
 * -- around everything:		works
 * -- around the (*func) call		fails
 * -- around all of exec_for_host	works
 * -- Around the "when to update"	fails
 * -- The when-to-update's & func code	works
 * -- Around the /proc/parts code	fails	
 *
 * It appears to crash when we try to do the mount (?? maybe BLKRRPART) of one
 * disk at the same time as the kernel is recognizing/processing another disk.
 * This can happen on bootup, or when a daisy-chained hub is plugged in.
 * And other times, when mounting lots of disks at once via the admin
 * interface.
 *
 * The problem isn't _this_ drive.  The problem is another drive that the
 * kernel is recognizing/processing (in another thread) _after_ this drive.
 * It we ask the kernel to do something with _this_ drive at the same time it is
 * working on _that_ later drive, then it tends to crash.
 * The work-around is to stall our processing of _this_ drive until after
 * the kernel has finished its work on _that_ drive.  Kinda hard for us to do,
 * since we don't yet know that _that_ drive even exists!
 * I've tried all sorts of things to try to detect/avoid the problem.
 * Thw worst time is when a hub & discs are first detected (bootup or initial
 * plugin.  Because the kernel automatically reads the partition table as the
 * disks are detected.

/* Plugging or removing usb device
 *
 * On an occurrance, multiple hotplug events may be fired off.
 * For example, if a hub is plugged or unplugged, an event
 * will be generated for everything downstream of it, plus one for
 * the hub itself.  These are fired off simultaneously, not serially.
 * This means that many many hotplug processes will be running at
 * the same time.
 *
 * The hotplug event generated by the kernel gives us several pieces
 * of information:
 * PRODUCT is vendorid/productid/rev#.
 * DEVICE is /proc/bus/usb/bus#/dev#
 * ACTION is add or remove
 * SCSI_HOST is the host (controller) number (this relies on the custom kernel patch)
 *
 * Note that when we get a hotplug add event, the USB susbsystem may
 * or may not have yet tried to read the partition table of the
 * device.  For a new controller that has never been seen before,
 * generally yes.  For a re-plug of a controller that has been seen
 * before, generally no.
 *
 * On a remove, the partition info has not yet been expunged.  The
 * partitions show up as /dev/discs/disc#/part#, and /proc/partitions.
 * It appears that doing a "stat" for a non-existant partition will
 * causes the kernel to re-validate the device and update the
 * partition table info.  However, it won't re-validate if the disc is
 * mounted--you'll get a "Device busy for revalidation (usage=%d)" in
 * syslog.
 *
 * The $INTERFACE is "class/subclass/protocol"
 * Some interesting classes:
 *	8 = mass storage
 *	7 = printer
 *	3 = HID.   3/1/2 = mouse.
 *	6 = still image (6/1/1 = Digital camera Camera)
 *	9 = Hub
 *
 * Observed:
 *	Hub seems to have no INTERFACE (null), and TYPE of "9/0/0"
 *	Flash disk seems to have INTERFACE of "8/6/80", and TYPE of "0/0/0"
 *
 * When a hub is unplugged, a hotplug event is generated for it and everything
 * downstream from it.  You cannot depend on getting these events in any
 * particular order, since there will be many hotplug programs all fired off
 * at almost the same time.
 * On a remove, don't try to access the downstream devices right away, give the
 * kernel time to finish cleaning up all the data structures, which will be
 * in the process of being torn down.
 *
 * On the initial plugin, the first time the kernel usb-storage subsystem sees
 * the host (identified by GUID), it automatically reads the partition table.
 * On subsequent plugins, it does not.
 *
 * Special values for Web Administration to unmount or remount
 * all partitions of the host:
 *	INTERFACE=TOMATO/...
 *	ACTION=add/remove
 *	SCSI_HOST=<host_no>
 * If host_no is negative, we unmount all partions of *all* hosts.
